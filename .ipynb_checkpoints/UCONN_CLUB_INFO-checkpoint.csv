17,Alpha Omicron Pi,"Alpha Omicron Pi (ΑΟΠ, AOII) is an international women's fraternity promoting friendship for a lifetime, and inspiring both academic excellence and lifelong learning.","ΑΟΠ was founded on January 2, 1897 at Barnard College on the campus of Columbia University in New York. Its founders were Stella George Stern Perry, Helen St. Clair Mullan, Elizabeth Heywood Wyman, and Jessie Wallace Hughan. The founders met in the Columbia Law Library to begin their fraternity and to forever seal their friendships and the friendships of all future members. The philosophy which the founders guided their principles included membership to women who share their belief in lifelong friendship, service and love. Membership is offered to women regardless of ethnicity, religion or socio-economic background.
Today, Alpha Omicron Pi is an international women's fraternity, with 208 collegiate chapters (active and inactive combined) and 320 alumnae chapters in Canada and the U.S.A. Its international headquarters is located in Brentwood, Tennessee, and it is a member group of the National Panhellenic Conference, which is the governing council of the 26 member women's fraternities and sororities. It is the only member to the NPC to have one official color (cardinal), as all the other members have two to four official colors.
Like many other Greek organizations for women, Alpha Omicron Pi is a fraternity, not a sorority, although both terms are often used. The term sorority was not yet in widespread use at the time of Alpha Omicron Pi's founding, and therefore it is officially a ""fraternity for women."" The fraternity promotes the values of service, scholarship, and leadership.
Alpha Omicron Pi has only one jewel, the ruby. The occasional use of pearls or diamonds in special badges has no significance or special meaning.
A sheaf of wheat is a common symbol in AOΠ, found in the new member pin, the rings for the chapter president, alumnae chapter president, and International president. The binding together of wheat into a sheaf in the new member pin represents individuals bound by the common bond of Alpha Omicron Pi. The wheat indicates usefulness in its harvest.
The nineteenth-century French rose, 'Général Jacqueminot', a deep red rose, was chosen as the flower of Alpha Omicron Pi because its color is the symbol of the central and essential virtue of the fraternity. Its choice had no connection with any legend, poem or story. This strong red rose, with its overtones of courage and vigor, was selected for its richness of color and fragrance, combined with softness and modesty of bearing. The Jacqueminot rose is not available at most florists, so any deep red rose which is available may be used.
Believing in their beginnings in Greek tradition, ΑΟΠ does not have a coat of arms, but uses a Jacqueminot rose as their symbol. A coat of arms is a medieval or masonic tradition, and therefore has no roots in the Greek tradition. ΑΟΠ is the only Greek organization without a coat of arms.",https://uconntact.uconn.edu/organization/alphaomicronpi

24,America Reads,America Reads works with K-5 students across CT to enhance students’ reading and writing skills through in-person literacy enrichment workshops.,"America Reads is a volunteer program that provides a valuable service to K-5 students. It stems from a nationwide effort to improve literacy and overall academic achievement in the U.S. This is a crucial aspect of education to focus on because we use our language skills so often. The ability to read fluently and comprehensively is often taken for granted, though it’s something that demands significant effort throughout K-5 education.
We attempt to create a more equitable, diverse learning environment to bridge achievement gaps that befall students. This is especially valuable as COVID-19 has introduced additional strain in the educational system.
Volunteers support this initiative by giving students direct help in the classroom through work in small groups or one-on-one. Mentors find fulfillment in providing children with an enriching educational experience that directs children towards meaningful careers.   
Volunteers are expected to devote 2 hours a week and attend monthly meetings/trainings to develop tutoring skills and strategies.

All of our past and current members have the intention of contributing to the educational security of underprivileged children in India.  Our efforts are in conjunction with a nation-wide movement to help increase academic opportunities for the youth in India.  The South-Asian country has over one billion people, many of whom exist in poverty.  Therefore, education is source of freedom for the younger generations as they try and escape the oppressive cycle of destitution.
In the past we were able to help the children at the D.F. Blind School in Calcutta, India. The academic institute takes in children who are visually impaired and gives them a free education that parallels the curriculum that is used in standard public schools. The students are endowed with innovative tools and technology so that they can do math and write. They are also taught domestic skills, such as sewing and farming. Most importantly, the students at the D.F. Blind School learn how to read braille, which is an ability that will help them become a part of India’s functional society.
The money that UConn Asha has raised in these past three years has helped the D.F. Blind School to double in size, install a playground, and add new dormitories, classrooms, and a library. We conduct our annual large fundraising event to raise funds for the underpriveleged children in India . In 2010, we hosted a world-famous acapella group named Penn Masala and had them perform at a concert in Jorgensen. We raised over $3,000 at the event. Currently, we are raising money for the children at the Navarsajan Trust Schools in Gujarat India.  The money we raise provides scholarships for the education of female students during the school year.

62,Big Brothers Big Sisters,One-on-one mentoring program for elementary and middle schoolers. Provide basic homework help and engage with recreational activities to develop a mentoring relationship with one child for up to 4 years!,"Since 1904, the National organization of Big Brothers Big Sisters has operated under the belief that inherent in every child is incredible potential. As the nation’s largest donor- and volunteer-supported mentoring network, Big Brothers Big Sisters makes meaningful, monitored, matches between adult volunteers (“Bigs”) and children (“Littles”).
 
Normally here at UConn, our school’s chapter works in nearby Windham and Putnam school districts, in both their elementary and middle schools. Our program runs once a week at each of the 7 different sites (see a full schedule of available times below) as an after school program at the students’ school, and we provide transportation both to and from the schools. We incorporate an academic component through a tutoring/ homework session each week with your Little, as well as leaving plenty of time for the two of you to have fun as a pair, as well as getting involved in group activities! Most sites have access to school playgrounds, fields, computer labs, and gyms so there is something fun to do for everyone. 
 
For Fall 2023: We will be working with the children in person during their after school time blocks. You will be selected for one site and be paired one-on-one with a child. For programming, the plan is to do activities and potentially help with homework as needed, but ultimately the program will be flexible as needed to still provide quality mentorship experiences to the children.
 
What makes our program unique is that we are a one-on-one mentoring program that focuses on developing positive relationships that have a direct and lasting effect on the lives of young students. You will work with the same child each week, allowing for a great opportunity to really get to know your Little as the year progresses. If both you and your Little stay in the program, you can also stay with the Little for your entire college career, honing that relationship even further. Because the children are relying on you to be a strong role model for them, we ask that you view this program as a minimum commitment of two consecutive semesters in order to thoroughly develop that relationship to its fullest extent.
 
BBBS as a whole aims to create higher aspirations, greater confidence, and better relationships. We help with the avoidance of risky behaviors as well as educational success.

Although none of us are medical professionals as of now, we will work together to research different conditions and provide the most accurate information.

244,Husky Case Competition Club,"The Husky Case Competition Club was founded on the understanding that students need real world business experience. This Club focuses on competing in business related case competitions that better prepare students for classes, future Internships, & Jobs.","Our Founding Idea:  
*If interested in applying, click this link.
The Husky Case Competition Club was founded on the understanding that real world business situations provide headway in gaining skills and understanding that is beneficial in today’s workforce. Today at school, students are taught the orthodox way of learning that includes tests and textbooks. While beneficial, that way of learning does not translate directly to our prospective careers. To fill that void, the Club’s focus is in the area of competing in business related case competitions, which prepares students for future classes, jobs, and internships while also providing opportunities for networking at these events. We focus on diversification with our case competitions, allowing members to sign up for different types of competitions that lie under the topic of business. Our main goal is giving members and students at UConn the skills and instincts that will give them an edge in the real world.
 
What We Do:
As a member of the Club, students are required to meet on a weekly basis, where we discuss upcoming case competitions. The eBoard provides a member sign up for available case competitions. The Club highly encourages students to participate in case competitions that do not necessarily correlate with one’s major, to allow students to participate in real world situations and expose them to scenarios that may expand their career options. The next step is pairing students up with competitions. However, a student’s interest is not the only consideration when picking competition teams: the Club tries to elicits from members their strengths and weaknesses to structure groups in a way that optimally unitizes everyone’s capabilities. For example, Club member A is proficient in Python, Club member B knows the ins and outs of Excel, and Club member C understands how financial valuation works. By putting these three different individuals on the same team, a highly functioning team is born. Furthermore, the Club will encourage these students to expose and teach each other their respective skillsets. Although, a student cannot be expected teach his/her teammate proficiency in any given area,  that exposure can spark an interest in an unexpected area. Finally, the Club provides the opportunity, and will encourage, its members to practice leaders skills, which also includes being an avid listener. We emphasize the idea of trial and error, as it allows members to understand what works and what does not work, so when member has an interview or an important decision to make in the workplace, they have an already developed instinct to execute a solution.
We want every member to utilize their full potential at UCONN while accesses recourses and connections that might be hidden to others. While the focus of the Club is case competitions, we will also encourage members to share their skillset and providing others with information regarding university resources and connections. During weekly meetings, we will schedule student workshops, provide resources, and invite University representatives to present informative relevant information. For example, a member who is proficient in operating Excel might create a presentation/workshop regarding the usefulness of the software, while also guiding them to available UConn resources. Our Club will also provide career development workshops where members can obtain advice on topics like resumes, LinkedIn, networking, cover letters, and interviews. Underclassmen/women will have the opportunity to pair up with upperclassmen/women mentors with a similar major and discuss classes and professors and provide tips on how to succeed at UCONN. Every meeting will start with a brief review of business current events to keep our members in the know. At our club diversification is key as we want our members from different backgrounds and want to expose them to various skills, and different career paths.
           
For Future Members:
Our Club welcomes all business majors and other students with other majors who have a passion for business, teamwork, and sharpening skills that will translate fluently into the real world. Diversification is our main goal, and we want members to feel like the Club allowed them to unitize every available academic experience. The founding eight members, who have stellar academic achievements and are seeking and/or participating in sophisticated internships/jobs, wish to provide members with advice and opportunities to grow as a young professional.

Critical thinking, creativity, and open-mindedness are skills required to be on the team. Since UConn iGEM conducts its student-driven research project over the summer, full-time summer internships are supported through the team when funding can be raised.
Furthermore, students who wish to participate in the lab research component must also take the UConn iGEM training sessions that are offered in the Spring. This lab training course instructs students on necessary wet lab techniques to allow them to contribute and participate in project development.
In addition to research, UConn iGEM also educates the public about Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering more broadly through community outreach events for UConn as well as the surrounding communities in Connecticut.
Meetings for Fall 2023 will be on Tuesdays from 7:00-8:00 PM in the Engineering Sciences Building's Lobby. ",https://uconntact.uconn.edu/organization/uconnget

HOW WE BEGAN:
UConn Tap was a student-run organization at the University of Connecticut. The club was founded in the Fall 2003 semester, and has since become an official club at the University of Connecticut (January 2004). Starting in the Fall 2004 semester, the interest increased so much that we expanded into the UConn Tap Team of 18 members, now 19, requiring auditions. 
The Tap Team began competing in January 2005. We are an organization of tap dancers who wish to expand upon our talents and learn new methods, steps, and more from each other. Through tap, we strive to create connections with others, both those who tap, as well as those who do not.

Auditions are held at the beginning of every Fall semester.

Can we find our own answers to age old questions of good, evil, truth, and illusions? Or rather, must these very questions be revised to render them sensible and answerable? By interweaving opposing viewpoints, we are able to arrive at a subtler understanding of pressing issues. This is one of the reasons that community, diversity, and friendship are amongst our chief values. We aim to create an environment that challenges people's beliefs but remains cordial and supportive to members of the UConn community. Our endeavors are grounded in changing our minds and hearts, and influencing how we live in the world and with ourselves. Living wisely is among our chief aims.
 
Welcome to the Undergraduate Philosophy Society! We are open to students of all areas of study, and most of our members are non-philosophy majors. No background in philosophy is necessary. We discuss a broad range of topics such as: What is the foundation of human knowledge? What are the ethical considerations of animal ownership and caretaking? How far can humanity depart from nature before violating our ethical principles? Is stepping into a teleporter suicide? To what degree is it ethical to alter one's life for the sake of societal norms? How much can we really know about our own minds while dwelling inside of them, and does this give us a more or less accurate perspective on them? What is the role of science in society, and what are the limits of what science can teach us? Are human reason and emotion always in conflict or do they mutually support each other?
